**Chapter 5 - Arrays**

- Arrays are variables which can hold more than one value.

const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "grapes"]
const a1 = [7, "Jayesh", false]     //can be different types

**Accessing Values**
let numbers = [1,2,7,9]
numbers[0]  //1
numbers[1]  //2

**Finding the length**
let numbers = [1,7,9,21]
numbers[0]  //1
numbers.length  //4

**Changing the values**
let numbers = [7,2,40,9]
numbers[2] =8   //"Numbers" now becomes [7,2,8,9]

- Arrays are mutable 
- Arrays can be changed
- In JS, arrays are objects.
- The type of operator of arrays returns object.
    const n = [1,7,9]
    type of n   //returns "object"
- Arrays can hold many values under a single name.

**Array Methods**
- There are some important array methods in JavaScript. Some of them are as follows:

1) toString() - converts an array to a string of comma separated values.
let n = [1,7,9]
n.toString()    // 1,7,9 

2) join() - joins all the array elements using a separator
let n = [7,9,13]
n.join("-") // 7-9-13
