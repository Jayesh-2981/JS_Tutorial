**Chapter 7 - Walking the DOM**

- DOM tree refers to the HTML page where all the notes are objects.
- There can be 3 main types of nodes in the DOM tree :

1. text nodes
2. element nodes
3. comment nodes

- In a HTML page, <html> is at the root and <head> and <body> are its children, etc.

- A text node is always a leaf of the tree.

**Auto Correction**

- If an erroneoud HTML is encountered by the browser, it tends to correct it.
- for example, if we put something after the body, it is automatically moved inside the body.
- Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody>

**Walking the DOM**

<html>
<head>
<title> Hello </title>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

- document.body => page body tag
- document.head => page head tag
- document.documentElement => page HTML tag

- **Note**
- Document body can sometimes be null if the javascript is written before the body tag.

**Children of an Element**

- Direct as well as deeply nested elements of an element are called its children.
- Child nodes => Elements that are direct children. for example, head and body are children of <html>
- Descendant nodes => All nested elements, childrens, there childrens and so on...

**firstChild, lastChild, childNodes**

- element.firstChild => first child element
- element.lastChild => last child element
- element.childNodes => All child nodes

- Following is always true:
- elem.childNodes[0] === elem.firstChild
- elem.childNodes[elem.childNodes.length -1 ] === elem.lastChild

- There is also a method elem.hasChildNodes() to check whether there are any child nodes.

**Note**

- childNodes looks like an array.
- But its not actually an array but a collection.
- We can use Array from (Collection) to convert it into an array. _Array methods will not work_

**Notes on DOM Collections**

- They are read-only
- They are live, elem.childNodes variable(reference) will automatically update if childNodes of elem is changed.
- They are iterable using for...of loop.

**Siblings and the Parent**

- Siblings are nodes that are childrens of the same parent

- Example: <head> and <body> are siblings
- Siblings have same parent.
- In the above example its html

- <body> is said to be the "next" or "right" sibling of <head>, <head> is said to be the "previous" are "left" sibling of <body>

- The next sibling is in nextSibling property, and the previous one in previous sibling.
- The parent is available as parentNode.

- alert(document.documentElement.parentNode); //document
- alert(document.documentElement.parentElement); //null
